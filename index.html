                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Hey there! I’m a Digital Media professional with over 5 years tucked under my belt, weaving through
                    the realms of content creation, digital ad campaigns, and audience engagement across various
                    platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. Currently calling digital media strategies that align
                    with some pretty important initiatives.</p>

                <p>Back at Radancy, I wore the hat of a Digital Account Executive, steering the ship for omni-channel
                    marketing campaigns and collaborating with a dynamic mix of teams. Oh, and I got to play around with
                    some cool tools like Google RD360 and Radancy Programmatic Platforms!</p>



                <p> University of Florida saw me rocking the role of a Social Media Coordinator, where I had my hands
                    full curating content, tuning into reproductive issues, and joining creative forces with a talented
                    bunch to roll out coherent campaigns.</p>

                <p>Early in the windy city, Chicago, with Jasculca Terman, I cut my teeth in managing client
                    relationships, delving into the digital advertising scene, and optimizing content with Salesforceand
                    Adobe Creative Cloud Suite.

                <p>Outside the 9-to-5, I’m all about consulting, boosting organic reach on platforms, and once made
                    waves with a political campaign video on TikTok – talk about engagement! Plus, I’m on the journey of
                    mastering Mass Communication with a side of Web Design and Development at the University of Florida,
                    ensuring every project is ADA compliant.</p>

                <p>In a nutshell, I’m all about bridging the gap between art and audience, solving complex puzzles in
                    the digital space, and making connections that count. Whether it’s through compelling content,
                    innovative strategies, or accessible design, I’m here to make a digital mark!</p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I'm, a passionate comic book enthusiast with a deep-seated love for the vibrant worlds and dynamic
                    characters that leap off the pages. From the moment I first delved into the colorful panels and
                    gripping narratives, I was hooked! Comics have been a constant companion, offering me an escape into
                    realms of superheroes, villains, and endless possibilities.</p>

                    alt="cartoon drawing of a comic character">

                <p>I have a particular fondness for the classics – think Spider-Man swinging between skyscrapers and
                    Batman lurking in the shadows of Gotham City. But my love for comics isn't just limited to the caped
                    crusaders; I'm equally drawn to indie comics, where the storytelling is raw, and the art is
                    boundary-pushing. Exploring diverse genres and styles, from fantasy to sci-fi, and drama to humor,
                    has only deepened my appreciation for the medium.</p>
                <p>Beyond just a hobby, comics have shaped my worldview, taught me valuable life lessons, and fueled my
                    creativity. I often find myself sketching out my characters and dreaming up my storylines, aspiring
                    to contribute my voice to this dynamic and ever-evolving art form.</p>
                <p>In the end, my love for comics is more than just a passion; it's a way of life. Whether I'm
                    flippingthrough the pages of a new release or revisiting a beloved classic, I'm continually
                    discovering, learning, and growing as a person. And I wouldn’t have it any other way!"</p>
